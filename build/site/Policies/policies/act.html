<h3 id="_rationale"><a class="anchor" href="#_rationale"></a>Rationale</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RISC-V Architectural Tests (ACT) are an evolving set of tests that are
created to help ensure that SW written for a given RISC-V Profile will
run on all implementations that comply with that profile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These tests also help ensure that the implementer has both understood
and implemented the specification.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The RISC-V Architectural Tests test suite is a minimal filter. Passing
the tests and having the results approved by RISC-V International is one
of the prerequisites to being listed as RISC-V ISA Compatible. Details
of RISC-V trademark usage may be found on the RISC-V International Web
page at <a href="https://riscv.org/" class="bare">https://riscv.org/</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Passing the RISC-V Architectural Tests does <strong><em>not</em></strong> mean that the design
complies with the RISC-V Architecture. These are only a basic set of
tests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The RISC-V Architectural Tests are <strong><em>not</em></strong> a substitute for rigorous
design verification; it is the responsibility of the implementer to
deploy extensive testing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_policy"><a class="anchor" href="#_policy"></a>Policy</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_who_must_test"><a class="anchor" href="#_who_must_test"></a>Who Must Test</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyone who develops RTL or a functional model for a RISC-V core and
wants to be listed as RISC-V ISA Compatible (e.g., in order to use the
RISC-V Compatible trademarks) needs to run the tests and file the
resulting test report as a step in the RISC-V Compatible listing
process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An entity (e.g., a value-added reseller) who has licensed core IP from a
developer and does not alter that IP can rely on the developer’s RISC-V
ISA Compatible listing. This includes cases where the entity has
selected configuration parameters from a range of values provided by the
developer, as long as the core with those chosen parameters is listed as
RISC-V Compatible. An entity that has otherwise modified the IP must get
the new design listed as RISC-V ISA Compatible by passing the
appropriate RISC-V ACT and by self-certifying that the changed design is
RISC-V compatible.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_must_be_tested"><a class="anchor" href="#_what_must_be_tested"></a>What Must be Tested</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The RTL or functional model of the core design must run and pass all of
the tests within the ACT that RISC-V International says are required for
the targeted profile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In any of these cases, implementers must provide a simulation
environment (RTL or functional) with sufficient resources to run the
required ACT tests in the framework that selects tests, configures the
reference model to generate appropriate reference signatures, and
generates a test report based on comparing the reference model’s
signature with the implementation’s signature file. These simulation
environment resources include, but are not necessarily limited to:
sufficient memory capacity to load and run the tests, the reference
model, the architectural test repository, the tools needed to compile,
link, load and run the tests, the ability to respond to the signal that
the test is complete, and the ability to extract the resulting test
signature from the memory and save it in a file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unless specified otherwise by RVI, the reference model to be used is the
Sail RISC-V Sequential Emulator produced from the most recently released
Sail Formal Specification of the RISC-V ISA. When the Sail Formal
Specification doesn’t yet fully support all of the necessary features of
the ISA, RVI may specify that the SPIKE emulator is to be used. In some
rare cases, RVI may specify that the QEMU emulator is to be used. In all
cases, RVI will specify which versions of the emulators to use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each release version of ACT will document the version of the toolchain
utilities required to support the instructions used for that version of
the tests in a repository README file. This will also include which
reference model to use for the test as well as any other environmental
requirements (e.g., amount of RAM).</p>

<h4 id="_where_to_report_test_results"><a class="anchor" href="#_where_to_report_test_results"></a>Where to Report Test Results</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ACT framework will generate a test report file with the name<br>
&lt;instanceID&gt;-&lt;test-date&gt;.html with the &lt;test-date&gt; in YYYY-MM-DD format
using GMT as the time zone. The &lt;instanceID&gt; is a string that identifies
which version of an implementer’s core is being tested..</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to pass/fail indications for each individual test that is
run, the report will include:</p>

<p>There are some special cases where it is not possible for an
implementation to pass all of the tests due to issues that may be
outside of the implementer’s control. A Test-Case Waiver is special
permission granted to exclude a test-case (or in some situations, test
cases) from the required tests. This allows implementations to
conditionally pass the ACT as long as all non-waived test cases pass.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A waiver request must be filed as an issue in the test-report github
repository specifically requesting the waiver and mentioning the Pull
Request number of the filed test report. In all cases, the appropriate
ISA Committee and the SW Committee (or other appropriate non-ISA
committee) must approve using a majority vote to approve each waiver for
the specific design and test. The approval will be documented by filing
it into the same test-report github repository with a name containing
the same PR number as the waiver.</p>

<p>If there is a demonstrable bug in the test, reference model, or tool
chain that causes a test to fail, a Flawed-Test Test-Case Waiver may be

a result that differs from what the implementation produces, and that
result is one of several results that is considered correct by the rules
of the ISA (e.g. WARL behavior that tests don’t support).<br>

<p>If a design fails on a test case, and the implementer believes that the
failure is due to either an ambiguity in the ISA or that the ISA is
inappropriately restrictive in the allowed behavior, the implementer

However, if the architecture is subsequently changed, the appropriate
tests will also be changed.</p>

<p>It is incumbent upon the implementer to run the ACT early enough in the
design process so that any failures can be investigated and design
changes incorporated. Likewise, any issues with the tests, including
unexpected results from the reference design (especially in the case
where more than one result can be considered correct) need to be brought
to the attention of the appropriate ISA Committee as soon as possible.
That said, the implementer needs to have performed enough verification
on the design before attempting to run the ACT, such that the ACT is not
used to find bugs. The rationale here is the ACT is a spot check
intended to find major flaws in a verified design; any failures in the
ACT point to a major gap in the understanding of the architecture or the
design verification process.</p>
