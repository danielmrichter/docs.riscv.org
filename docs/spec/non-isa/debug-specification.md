Outlines a standard architecture for debug support on RISC-V hardware platforms. This architecture allows a variety of implementations and tradeoffs, which is complementary to the wide range of RISC-V implementations. At the same time, this specification defines common interfaces to allow debugging tools and components to target a variety of hardware platforms based on the RISC-V ISA.
